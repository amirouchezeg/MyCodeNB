List<Date> a;
contains : 10/10/2014, 10/11/2016

List<Date> b;
contains : 10/10/2016

//code 1

You can convert them to Set collections, and perform a set difference operation on them.

Like this:

Set<Date> ad = new HashSet<Date>(a);
Set<Date> bd = new HashSet<Date>(b);
ad.removeAll(bd);

//code 2

If you only want find missing values in b, you can do:

List toReturn = new ArrayList(a);
toReturn.removeAll(b);

return toReturn;


If you want to find out values which are present in either list you can execute upper code twice. With changed lists.
